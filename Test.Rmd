## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)

```

There are `r nrow(cars)` cars


**Cell types:**

Blood Monocytes (BM):  

Alveolar Macrophages (AM):

Interstitial Macrophages (IM): 


Macrophages	Alveolar macrophages **(AM)** High autofluorescent!!	CD11b−, CD11c+, CD64+, CD206+, CD169+, MerTK+, Siglec-F+
<br /><br />
Interstitial macrophages **(IM)** Non-Autofluorescent!!	CD11b+, CD11clo/+, CD64+, CD206+, CD169+/−, CX3CR1+, MerTK+, CCR2+/−, (Siglec F-)
<br /><br />
Monocyte-derived cells	Monocyte-derived macrophages (acute lung injury)	CD11b+, CD64+, CX3CR1+, Ly6C+/−, CCR2+/−
<br /><br />
Monocytes	Classical monocytes (inflammatory)	CD11b+, CD115+, CCR2+, F4/80 +, CD43lo, CXCR1(int), CD62L+, Ly6C-hi
<br />
*Mono to Macro "waterfall"* : Ly6C(hi) MHCII(lo) mono recruited into tissue and converted to Ly6C(lo) MHCII (hi) Macrophages	
<br /><br />
Nonclassical monocytes (patrolling)	CD11b+, CD115+, F4/80 lo/+, CD43hi, CX3CR1hi, CXCR1(hi), CCR2-, CD62L-, Ly6C-lo



```{r car}
head(cars)

datatable(cars)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
